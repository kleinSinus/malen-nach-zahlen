# Color Mapper v 0.1
#
# author: Wilhelm Simus
# 
# This tool takes an input image and a color palette and reduces the image to only colors of said
# palette. The output gets written into its own image file in the same location as the input image.
# 
# Input arguments:
# - file location relative to this script
# - file location for the color palette (optional)
# - used measurement of color distance (optional)
