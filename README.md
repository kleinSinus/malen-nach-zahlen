# Malen nach Zahlen / Painting by numbers

Trying my hand at image color reduction, direct use: creating "painting by numbers"-images for my nieces and nephews and other interested folk

## Version one ... reduce test images to 10 basic colors

I have chosen the following 10 basic colors typically found in children's watercolor sets around my place:
- Yellow (255, 242, 0)
- Orange (255, 127, 39)
- Red (237, 28, 36)
- Pink/Rose (255, 174, 201)
- Violet (163, 73, 164)
- Blue (63, 72, 204)
- Light Blue (0, 162, 232)
- Green (34, 177, 76)
- Light Green (181, 230, 29)
- Ochre / Gold (255, 201, 14)
- Brown (185, 122, 87)
- Black (30, 30, 30)

I want to reserve (0, 0, 0) for the outlines, s.t. there is no overlap after rendering pictures with black areas.
